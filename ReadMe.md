<p align="center">
<a href="https://github.com/lotabout/skim">skim</a> (fuzzy finder) integration into <a href="https://xon.sh/">xonsh</a> (shell)
<br>
Sets up keybinds to search various type of data: dirs/files, history of commands/CWDs/dirs, ssh hosts...
</p>


## Installation

To install use pip:

```xsh
xpip install xontrib-skim
# or: xpip install -U git+https://github.com/eugenesvk/xontrib-skim
```

## Usage

Supported data sources:

  - xonsh history of commands (and their frequency)
  - xonsh history of commands' CWDs (and the frequency of commands started here)
  - zoxide's history of dirs
  - (CWDs and dirs) support multi-selection (with proper escape-quoting) as well as `cd`-ing to the selected dir
  - files in the current directory and its sub-directories
  - dirs in the current directory and its sub-directories
  - ssh hosts from `/etc/ssh/ssh_config`, `~/.ssh/config`, `~/.ssh/known_hosts`

This xontrib requires `sk` (or `sk-tmux`) to be in `PATH`. If it's added to `PATH` via another xontrib (e.g, you installed it via Homebrew and use `xontrib-homebrew`), then you should load this xontrib after the one setting `PATH`

1. Add the following to your `.py` xontrib loading config and `import` it in your xonsh run control file (`~/.xonshrc` or `~/.config/rc.xsh`):
```py
from xonsh.xontribs 	import xontribs_load
from xonsh.built_ins	import XSH
envx = XSH.env

xontribs = [ "skim", # Initializes skim (polyglot asdf-like runtime manager)
 # your other xontribs
]
# ↓ optional configuration variables (use `False` to disable a keybind)
if 'skim' in xontribs: # Configure skim only if you're actually loading it
  # config var                	  value	 |default|alt_cmd¦ comment
  envx["X_SKIM_KEY_HIST"]     	= "⎈s" 	#|c-s|             False¦ Search in history entries and insert the chosen command
  envx["X_SKIM_KEY_HIST_CWD→"]	= "⎇s" 	#|['escape','s']|  False¦ Search in history entries' CWD and CD to the selected item (if exists, do nothing otherwise)
  envx["X_SKIM_KEY_HIST_CWD"] 	= "⎈⎇s"#|['escape','c-s']|False¦ Search in history entries' CWD and insert the selected item(s)
  envx["X_SKIM_KEY_HIST_Z→"]  	= "⎇z"	#|['escape','z']|  False¦ Search in zoxide's history entries and CD to the selected item (if exists, do nothing otherwise)
  envx["X_SKIM_KEY_HIST_Z"]   	= "⎈⎇z"#|['escape','c-z']|False¦ Search in zoxide's history entries and insert the selected item(s)
  envx["X_SKIM_KEY_FILE"]     	= "⎈f"	#|c-f|             False¦ Find files in the current directory and its sub-directories
  envx["X_SKIM_KEY_DIR"]      	= "⎇f"	#|['escape','f']|  False¦ Find dirs  in the current directory and its sub-directories
  envx["X_SKIM_KEY_SSH"]      	= "⎈b"	#|c-b|             False¦ Run 'ssh HOST' for hosts in /etc/ssh/ssh_config, ~/.ssh/config, ~/.ssh/known_hosts
  # run to see the allowed list for ↑: from prompt_toolkit.keys import ALL_KEYS; print(ALL_KEYS)
  # Alt is also supported as either of: a- ⎇ ⌥ (converted to a prefix 'escape')
  # Control symbols are also supported as either of: ⎈ ⌃
  # ↓ are key bindings for the skim binary itself, not this xontrib, so use skim rules https://github.com/lotabout/skim#keymap
  envx["X_SKIM_KEY_SORT_TOGGLE"]	= "ctrl-r"	#|ctrl-r|False¦ ⎈R binding for 'toggle-sort'
  envx["X_SKIM_KEY_CUSTOM"]     	= None    	#|None| a dictionary of {'key':'action'}
  envx["X_SKIM_NO_HEIGHT"]      	= True    	#|True|False¦ disable `--height` to fix a skim bug
  envx["X_SKIM_NO_SORT"]        	= True    	#|True|False¦ disable history sorting
  envx["X_SKIM_CMD_FRQ"]        	= True    	#|True|False¦ add ∑command runs for a given command
  envx["X_SKIM_CMD_FRQ_MIN"]    	= 5       	#|5| hide frequency numbers below this
  envx["X_SKIM_CWD_FRQ"]        	= True    	#|True|False¦ add ∑command runs at a given CWD
  envx["X_SKIM_CWD_FRQ_MIN"]    	= 5       	#|5| hide frequency numbers below this
  envx["X_SKIM_CMD_FIND"]       	= "fd -t f -t l" #|None| command used by skim to search for files
  envx["X_SKIM_CMD_FIND_DIR"]   	= "fd -t d     " #|None| command used by skim to search for directories
  envx["X_SKIM_DIR_VIEW"]       	= "ls -F --color=always {2..}" #|None| preview function for Dir lists
  envx["SKIM_DEFAULT_OPTIONS"]  	= "--ansi --preview-window=right:40%:wrap" # |None| other options to pass to skim

xontribs_load(xontribs) # actually load all xontribs in the list
```

2. Or just add this to your xonsh run control file
```xsh
xontrib load skim # Initializes skim (fuzzy finder)
# configure like in the example above, but replace envx['VAR'] with $VAR
$X_SKIM_KEY_HISTORY	= "c-s" # ...
```

## Examples

- `cd` to a path in-place without losing the command you've already typed in the prompt!

    1. Press <kbd>⎇</kbd><kbd>s</kbd> (for command history CWD's) or <kbd>⎇</kbd><kbd>z</kbd> (for zoxide's history) to launch fuzzy finder of your favorite dirs<br/>
![cd inplace 1](<./doc/img/cd inplace 1.png>)

    2. Find the correct dir and insert it<br/>
![cd inplace 2](<./doc/img/cd inplace 2.png>)

    3. The prompt is updated in the background, reflecting the dir change and preserving the command<br/>
![cd inplace 3](<./doc/img/cd inplace 3.png>)

- Find fils/dirs in xonsh-completed paths: type `cd ~/Mus`; hit <kbd>⎈</kbd><kbd>F</kbd> to limit your file search to `~/Music`

- Find files with <kbd>⎈</kbd><kbd>F</kbd> and dirs with <kbd>⎇</kbd><kbd>F</kbd>
```py
envx["X_SKIM_KEY_FILE"]	= "⎇f"
envx["X_SKIM_KEY_DIR"] 	= "⎈f"
```

- Insert multiple paths with home row cursor keys
  <br/><kbd>⎇</kbd><kbd>J</kbd> to toggle and ▼
  <br/><kbd>⎇</kbd><kbd>K</kbd> to toggle and ▲
  ```py
  envx["X_SKIM_KEY_CUSTOM"]	= {
    'alt-j':'toggle+down'  	,
    'alt-k':'toggle+up'    	}
  ```

## Known issues

- skim doesn't clear the screen properly when `--height` is set due to a [bug](https://github.com/lotabout/skim/issues/494). At the moment this flag is disabled via `X_SKIM_NO_HEIGHT`
- skim sometimes prints extraneous text symbols, e.g., when searching history, maybe due to [this bug](https://github.com/lotabout/skim/issues/502) or something else
- skim might bug in tmux on some system/terminals [bug1](https://github.com/lotabout/skim/issues/482), [bug2](https://github.com/lotabout/skim/issues/412) 
- `toggle-sort` (and `X_SKIM_KEY_SORT_TOGGLE`) doesn't seem to be supported in skim, `ls | sk --bind=pgdn:toggle-sort` also fails
- to remove extra `?[38;5;26mFOLDER` from output, add `--ansi` to `$SKIM_DEFAULT_OPTIONS` or disable colors in your `$X_SKIM_CMD_FIND`/`DIR` filter (e.g., `fd -t d -c never`)
- <kbd>⎈</kbd>/<kbd>⎇</kbd><kbd>f</kbd> conflict with [xontrib-output-search](https://github.com/anki-code/xontrib-output-search)'s defaults
